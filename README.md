# Real-Time Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe

## Project Overview
This project is a real-time multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using modern web technologies. It allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe online in real-time, with the game state synchronized across both players' browsers.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Node.js**: The server-side runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, used to set up the server and routes.
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time bidirectional event-based communication library, enabling real-time gameplay.

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: Styling of the game board and user interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Client-side logic and DOM manipulation.
- **Socket.IO Client**: Client-side library for real-time communication with the server.

## Key Features
1. Real-time gameplay using Socket.IO
2. Multiple concurrent games support
3. Game state management on the server
4. Dynamic game board updates
5. Win/draw detection
6. Game reset functionality

## Technical Highlights

### Server-Side
- **Express static file serving**: Serves the client-side files.
- **Socket.IO event handling**: Manages game events like joining, moves, and game over scenarios.
- **Game state management**: Keeps track of multiple games simultaneously using a games object.
- **Win condition checking**: Implemented on the server to ensure game integrity.

### Client-Side
- **DOM manipulation**: Updates the game board in real-time.
- **Event listeners**: Handles user interactions with the game board.
- **Socket.IO event emission and handling**: Communicates moves and receives updates from the server.
- **Dynamic UI updates**: Reflects the current game state and turn information.

## Architecture
The application follows a client-server architecture where:
- The server maintains the authoritative game state.
- Clients send player actions to the server.
- The server validates moves, updates the game state, and broadcasts updates to connected clients.
- Clients update their UI based on server messages.

## Scalability Considerations
- The current implementation stores game states in memory, which may not be suitable for large-scale deployment.
- For improved scalability, consider implementing a database solution for game state persistence.
- Horizontal scaling can be achieved by using a load balancer and multiple server instances, with shared state managed through a service like Redis.

## Future Enhancements
- User authentication system
- Persistent game statistics
- Spectator mode for ongoing games
- AI opponent option for single-player mode
- Improved error handling and edge case management

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the implementation of a real-time multiplayer game using modern web technologies. It showcases the power of Socket.IO for real-time communication and provides a foundation for building more complex multiplayer web applications.
